URLNOTES: A cute hack to add annotations (like, say, a human translation) to any web page.

Run the sinatra app, then access /edit?url=<some URL you'd like to make notes about> in your favoritely flavored web-browser.

It's now using an sqlite datastore and no longer injecting HTML and CSS, but the URL in the form persists weirdly with the iframe.

You need to run lib/url_note.rb as a script to build out the tables in your database.
